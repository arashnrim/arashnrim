## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world, I'm Arash!

 I'm a student developer ardent about creating designed, intuitive, and practical products using technology. While that one-liner is fairly ambiguous, it gives me a purpose and motivation to create interesting (and hopefully helpful!) stuff.

### ðŸ›  I'm using...

- TypeScript (in 4 projects)
- Python (in 3 projects)
- Swift (in 2 projects)
- JavaScript (in 2 projects)
- Shell (in 1 project)
