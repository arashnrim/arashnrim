## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world, I'm Arash!

I'm a student with a passion for making a change through technology. While that one-liner is fairly ambiguous, it gives me a purpose and motivation to create interesting (and hopefully helpful!) stuff.

### ðŸ›  I'm using...

- Python (in 3 projects)
- TypeScript (in 1 project)
- Swift (in 2 projects)
