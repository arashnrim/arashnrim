## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world, I'm Arash!

I'm a student developer ardent about creating <dfn title="in a way that is aesthetically pleasing">designed</dfn>, <dfn title="in a way that feels natural to a user">intuitive</dfn>, and <dfn title="in a way that serves some use">practical</dfn> products using technology. I find that to be a rather ambitious statement, and rightfully so; I have a long way to go before getting there, but every step towards it counts!

I find joy in seeing the code I write come alive in one way or another â€” whether it's seeing it visually or just a command-line interface, most things I do are pretty interesting to me. I mostly deal with front-end web development at the moment, but would also like to have a go at any other parts of development.
